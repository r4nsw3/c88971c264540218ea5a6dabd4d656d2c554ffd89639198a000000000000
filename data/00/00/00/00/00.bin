  |   Hyperforma is a captivating story about a lone explorer who makes     |
  |   his journey into the relic cyberspace "Ancient Network", an           |
  |   artefact of a mysteriously vanished civilization of the past,         |
  |   hoping to reveal the secrets of its masters.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   During his search, the hero meets monumental "living" interfaces      |
  |   and overcomes numerous obstacles while breaching through the most     |
  |   complex defence systems to ultimately discover the truth, not only    |
  |   about the dramatic events of the past but also about his own being.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The gameplay of Hyperforma represents a reinvention of a classic      |
  |   puzzle-based arcade that is viewed as a hacking process of            |
  |   sophisticated virtual defence systems.                                |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Watts.                                                                |
